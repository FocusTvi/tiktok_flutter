# tiktok

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is the basics of tiktok. It's an app where you can play and pause a video with a tap on the screen. It allows to swipe up or down to watch more videos.

Remember to have the videos named as 1.mp4 , 2,3,4,5,6,7,etc in the folder assets/videos/ otherwise it won't work.
